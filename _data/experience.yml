    It all began when a close friend asked me to help him with a freelance job that has a tight deadline. 
    It brought me good money(at least for a student). Then we did more jobs and developed projects together. 
    After almost two years of studying & freelancing we graduated and established a small startup.
    
    Unelabs has accomplished more than enough. 
    Even if it did not make us rich and famous(apparently), it taught us a lot, not only technically but also socially, economically, etc. 
    Unelabs' main focus was Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality, but we also developed websites for money. 
    Old freelance habits... I was mostly developing APIs for our VR & AR apps. I had some Unity experience there too.

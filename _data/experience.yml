    It all begun when a close friend asked me to help him for a freelance job that has a tighth deadline. It brought me good money(at least for a student). Then we do more jobs and developed projects together. After almost two year of stundying & freelancing we graduated and established a small startup.
    Unelabs has accomplished more than enough. Even if it did not make us rich and famous(apparently), it tought us a lot, not only technically but also socially, economically etc. 
    Unelabs' main focus was Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality, but we also developed websites for money. Old freelance habits... I was mostly developing API's for our VR & AR apps. I had some Unity experince there too.

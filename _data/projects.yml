    At the beginning of my career, even when I was still a university student, 
    I had developed many websites for work and friends. 
    It taught me the basics of the web from basic HTML to backend frameworks like Laravel. 
    It's also a real full-stack experience that I have to register domains, deploy web apps, mind security concerns, SEO, backups, etc.

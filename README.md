## Running locally

Before you start make sure you have *Ruby* and the gems for *Jekyll* installed locally. You can find out how to do that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

1. `git clone https://github.com/yusufkoca/yusufkoca.github.io.git`
2. `cd yusufkoca.github.io`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser.

*Note: You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`.*
